## Sprint: Themed SEO Expansion Build
- **Estimate:** 5 days of iteration (small increments)
- **Focus:** Launch the first 5 themed word search pages with the shared template, checkpoint internal links, and confirm analytics/SEO signals before moving to the next batch.
- **Triggers:** Start once the SEO structure is approved and the puzzle component is stabilized for each new page.
