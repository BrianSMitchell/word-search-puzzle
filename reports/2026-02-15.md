## Recommendation

**RECOMMENDATION: Pinterest Blitz for Seasonal Printables**

**WHY:** With only 2 direct visitors and zero organic traffic, your site has a distribution problem, not a product problem. Pinterest is the primary discovery engine for printable educational content; teachers and parents actively search there for classroom activities, and word searches are highly "pinnable" visual content.

**WHAT TO DO:** Create 10 St. Patrick's Day/spring-themed word search PDFs. Design vertical Pinterest pins (1000x1500px) showing puzzle previews with text overlays like "Free Printable." Post 3-5 daily to Pinterest with keyword-rich descriptions ("word search printable," "classroom activity"), and simultaneously share direct download links in 3 teacher subreddits (r/Teachers, r/homeschool) and 5 Facebook teaching groups.

**EXPECTED IMPACT:** High - Pinterest drives 2-3x higher conversion for printables than other social channels; expect 100+ daily visitors within 14 days and backlink generation as teachers share resources.
