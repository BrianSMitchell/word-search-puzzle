## Recommendation

**RECOMMENDATION: Deploy Programmatic SEO Landing Pages**

**WHY:** With only 2 visitors and 100% bounce rate, your site lacks discoverability despite serving a high-search-volume niche (2M+ monthly "word search" queries). You're invisible to Google because you likely have too few indexed pages targeting specific long-tail terms.

**WHAT TO DO:** Auto-generate 500+ dedicated landing pages using your existing puzzle database, each targeting specific keywords like "printable dinosaur word search for kids" or "thanksgiving word search pdf." Ensure each page has: unique H1/title tags, 50+ word description, embedded interactive puzzle, and prominent "Download PDF" CTA. Submit new sitemap to Google Search Console immediately.

**EXPECTED IMPACT:** High - Transforms your site from a single landing page into an organic traffic engine that captures existing search demand for specific themes without paid acquisition costs.
