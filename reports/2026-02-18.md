## Recommendation

**RECOMMENDATION: Critical Path Functionality Audit**

**WHY:** 100% bounce rate with 4-second session duration indicates the puzzle generator may be broken or the page fails to load interactive elements, rendering all traffic acquisition useless until fixed.

**WHAT TO DO:** Open the site in a fresh browser (no cache) and attempt to generate a word search from start to finish. Record the process using Loom. Check browser console for JavaScript errors. If the "Generate" button fails or PDF download breaks, fix these before driving more traffic.

**EXPECTED IMPACT:** High - Current metrics suggest complete value delivery failure; fixing the core loop is required before any growth tactics.
