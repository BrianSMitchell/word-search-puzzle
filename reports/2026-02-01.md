## Recommendation

**RECOMMENDATION: Emergency Mobile Performance Audit & Search Console Submission**

**WHY:** 100% bounce rate with 0-second session duration on mobile devices indicates critical loading failures or broken analytics implementation, while zero organic traffic confirms the site isn't indexed by Google.

**WHAT TO DO:** Immediately test your homepage on a mobile device (not desktop) to verify it loads within 3 seconds; check that your analytics tracking code is placed in the `<head>` section; create and submit a sitemap.xml to Google Search Console; and run Google PageSpeed Insights to identify mobile rendering blockers.

**EXPECTED IMPACT:** High - Resolving the loading issue will convert your current direct traffic into actual users, while indexing unlocks organic search acquisition channels essential for growth.
