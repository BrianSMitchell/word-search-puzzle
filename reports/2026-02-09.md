## Recommendation

**RECOMMENDATION: Execute Valentine's Day Pinterest Blitz**

**WHY:** Zero organic traffic indicates a distribution crisis, not a product problem. Pinterest drives the majority of traffic for printable educational content, and Valentine's Day (Feb 14) is 5 days away—peak season for "valentine word search printable" queries.

**WHAT TO DO:** Create 3-5 Valentine's-themed puzzles immediately. Design tall pin images (1000x1500px) showing puzzle previews with text overlays like "Free Printable Valentine's Word Search." Post 2x daily to Pinterest targeting keywords: "classroom valentine activity," "kids valentine printable," and "valentine party game." Join 3-5 teacher/parent group boards and share there.

**EXPECTED IMPACT:** Medium - Should drive first meaningful traffic within 48 hours; seasonal urgency creates sharing momentum while you build long-term SEO.

**Bonus:** Add a popup capturing emails ("Get tomorrow's puzzle free") to convert this seasonal traffic into repeat visitors before they bounce.
