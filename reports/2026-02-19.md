## Recommendation

**RECOMMENDATION: Deploy Programmatic SEO Content Library**

**WHY:** With only 2 visits and 100% bounce rate, the site lacks indexed content to capture organic search traffic. Zero session duration indicates users find no entry points or value beyond a blank homepage.

**WHAT TO DO:** Auto-generate 100+ indexable puzzle pages targeting long-tail keywords (e.g., "/puzzles/dinosaur-word-search", "/puzzles/christmas-word-search"). Each page must include: (1) playable puzzle embedded, (2) PDF download button, (3) meta title "Free [Theme] Word Search Printable", (4) 50-word keyword-rich description. Submit XML sitemap to Google Search Console immediately after deployment.

**EXPECTED IMPACT:** High - Transforms site from zero organic discoverability to capturing high-intent "word search [topic]" searches, which typically drive 70%+ of traffic for puzzle sites.
