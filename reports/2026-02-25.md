## Recommendation

**RECOMMENDATION: Emergency Site Health Validation**

**WHY:** 100% bounce rate with 0s session duration indicates critical technical failure—the site may be broken, failing to load puzzles, or have broken tracking. Driving more traffic to a non-functional product is wasted effort.

**WHAT TO DO:** Immediately run Lighthouse/PageSpeed audits on mobile/desktop, manually test the puzzle generator flow from entry to PDF download, and verify Google Analytics 4 events are firing correctly. Fix any critical errors before pursuing growth.

**EXPECTED IMPACT:** High - Eliminating technical barriers is prerequisite to all optimization; a functional product is required before SEO, content, or conversion improvements can yield results.
