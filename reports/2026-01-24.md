## Recommendation

**RECOMMENDATION: Implement Internal Linking & Session Extension Strategy**

**WHY:** With only 3 visitors but an impressive 8m 42s average session duration, users are highly engaged once they arrive, but the 100% bounce rate indicates they're not discovering additional content on your site.

**WHAT TO DO:** 
1. Add "Related Puzzles" sections to every page showing 3-4 themed puzzles
2. Create a sticky navigation bar with quick links to Daily Puzzle, Generator, and Popular Themes
3. Add a "Try Another Puzzle" call-to-action button on puzzle completion pages
4. Implement exit-intent popups offering a free PDF download in exchange for email signup

**EXPECTED IMPACT:** High - Your users are already spending 8+ minutes engaged, indicating strong product-market fit. By improving discoverability of your existing content, you can likely reduce bounce rate to 60-70% and increase pages per session from 1.0 to 2-3, effectively doubling your engagement metrics without needing new traffic. This also builds your email list for future retention campaigns.
