## Recommendation

**RECOMMENDATION: Implement Immediate Engagement Hooks**

**WHY:** With 100% bounce rate and 0-second session duration, visitors are leaving instantly upon arrival, indicating the homepage fails to communicate value or engage users within the critical first few seconds.

**WHAT TO DO:** 
1. Add an interactive "Try It Now" word search puzzle directly on the homepage (no registration required)
2. Place a clear headline above it: "Find 5 Hidden Words in 60 Seconds - Can You Beat the Clock?"
3. Include a prominent timer and word list to create immediate engagement
4. After completion, show a success message with buttons to "Create Your Own Puzzle" and "Play Daily Challenge"

**EXPECTED IMPACT:** High - This addresses the core problem of instant abandonment by giving visitors an immediate, frictionless way to experience your product's value. Interactive content typically reduces bounce rates by 40-70% and transforms passive visitors into engaged users who understand what your site offers. Success with the demo puzzle creates natural momentum toward your main features.
