## Recommendation

**RECOMMENDATION: Validate Tracking & Deploy SEO Content Cluster**

**WHY:** Absolute zero metrics suggests either broken analytics (critical data blindness) or total search invisibility, both requiring immediate technical verification and content intervention before growth tactics can be measured.

**WHAT TO DO:** 1) Use Google Tag Assistant to confirm GA4 fires on all pages, especially puzzle generator and PDF download events. 2) If tracking works, publish 15 long-tail optimized puzzles targeting queries like "Valentine's Day word search 5th grade" or "hard printable animal puzzles" with proper title tags and schema markup to capture existing search demand.

**EXPECTED IMPACT:** High - Restores data integrity or establishes organic traffic baseline within 14 days, enabling future optimization decisions.
