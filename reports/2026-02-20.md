## Recommendation

**RECOMMENDATION: Deploy Programmatic SEO Landing Pages**

**WHY:** With only 1 visitor and 100% bounce, the site lacks discoverability. Word searches have massive organic search demand (2M+ monthly searches for "printable word search" variants), but you're capturing none of it.

**WHAT TO DO:** Generate 50+ landing pages targeting long-tail keywords like "printable word search [holiday]" and "[animal] word search pdf" using your existing themed puzzle database. Ensure each page has unique H1s, meta descriptions, and a visible "Download PDF" CTA above the fold. Submit new pages to Google Search Console immediately.

**EXPECTED IMPACT:** High - This creates sustainable organic traffic channels; educational/activity keywords have high intent and low competition, converting well to PDF downloads.
