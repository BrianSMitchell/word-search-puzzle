## Recommendation

**RECOMMENDATION: Deploy Long-Tail SEO Landing Pages**

**WHY:** With only 2 visitors and zero Google organic traffic (just 1 Bing referral), the site is invisible to high-intent searches. The 100% bounce rate on the generic homepage confirms users searching for specific puzzles (e.g., "printable Valentine's word search") land, don't find immediate relevance, and leave within 22 seconds.

**WHAT TO DO:** Create 5 dedicated landing pages targeting specific queries: "/make-word-search/", "/printable-animal-puzzles/", "/february-2026-word-search/", "/hard-word-search-pdf/", and "/daily-puzzle-answers/". Each page needs a unique puzzle embed, 150-character meta description, H1 matching search intent, and clear "Create Your Own" CTA. Submit URLs to Google Search Console immediately.

**EXPECTED IMPACT:** High - Long-tail pages capture specific search intent that generic homepages miss, converting the current 100% bounce rate into engaged sessions by delivering exactly what users searched for.
