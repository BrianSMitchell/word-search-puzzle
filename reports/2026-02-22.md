## Recommendation

**RECOMMENDATION: Emergency Technical Audit & SEO Foundation**

**WHY:** With only 1 visitor bouncing in 0 seconds, you face both a technical barrier (the /blog page likely has loading errors, broken scripts, or tracking issues) and a complete absence of organic acquisition channels. Zero session duration indicates users literally cannot access your content.

**WHAT TO DO:** 
1. **Fix the leak:** Test /blog across Chrome/Safari mobile and desktop; verify no 404s, JavaScript crashes, or 10+ second load times blocking engagement.
2. **Launch SEO clusters:** Create 10 optimized landing pages targeting "[Holiday/Theme] word search printable PDF" (e.g., "Spring word search printable")—high-intent keywords matching your PDF feature.
3. **Index immediately:** Submit XML sitemap to Google Search Console and verify the word search generator tool page is crawlable.

**EXPECTED IMPACT:** High - Resolving technical barriers ensures future traffic converts, while seasonal printable content captures active searchers ready to download, breaking the single-visitor trap within 30-60 days as pages index.
