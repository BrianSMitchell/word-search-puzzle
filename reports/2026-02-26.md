## Recommendation

**RECOMMENDATION: Emergency SEO Indexing & Content Seeding**

**WHY:** Zero traffic indicates Google hasn't indexed your site or you lack searchable content. The word search niche generates millions of monthly organic queries, but you need indexable pages to capture this demand.

**WHAT TO DO:** 1) Immediately verify your site in Google Search Console and submit your XML sitemap. 2) Publish a batch of 15-20 puzzles targeting high-volume keywords (e.g., "word search printable," "word search for kids," "animal word search") with unique title tags and meta descriptions. 3) Ensure each puzzle page loads under 2 seconds and is mobile-responsive.

**EXPECTED IMPACT:** High - Word searches are low-competition keywords; indexed pages typically rank and drive traffic within 7-14 days, establishing your baseline organic growth engine.
