## Recommendation

**RECOMMENDATION: Deploy Indexable Theme Landing Pages**

**WHY:** You're in a "cold start" trap—only 3 visitors bounced from your homepage at 100%, indicating zero long-tail search visibility. Your pre-made themed puzzles (holidays, animals, sports) likely live behind a single interface rather than as unique, crawlable URLs, preventing Google from sending targeted traffic for queries like "Christmas word search printable."

**WHAT TO DO:** Convert your top 10 puzzle themes into dedicated, indexable pages at `/puzzles/[theme-name]`. Each page must include: (1) the interactive puzzle above the fold, (2) a prominent PDF download button, (3) 200-300 words of thematic keyword-rich description, and (4) a CTA to your puzzle generator. Submit the XML sitemap to Google Search Console immediately.

**EXPECTED IMPACT:** High - Individual theme pages capture high-intent "long-tail" search traffic, provide specific entry points to reduce homepage bounce rates, and create organic growth flywheels without paid acquisition.
