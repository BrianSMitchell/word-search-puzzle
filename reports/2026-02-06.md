## Recommendation

**RECOMMENDATION: Emergency Technical Audit & Analytics Verification**

**WHY:** Zero traffic across all metrics indicates either broken analytics tracking, site inaccessibility, or complete lack of indexing—not a marketing problem. You cannot optimize what you cannot measure.

**WHAT TO DO:** 
1. Verify Google Analytics/tracking code is firing correctly using Real-Time reports and browser dev tools
2. Check site uptime (is the server live?) and robots.txt (ensure you're not blocking all crawlers)
3. Submit sitemap to Google Search Console and check for manual penalties
4. Test organic visibility by searching "site:yourdomain.com" in Google

**EXPECTED IMPACT:** High - This is a blocking issue. Until traffic registers in analytics, all other growth initiatives are flying blind. Fixing this establishes your measurement baseline within 24-48 hours.
