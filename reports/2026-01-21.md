## Recommendation

**RECOMMENDATION: Fix Critical Bounce Rate with Homepage Engagement Hook**

**WHY:** Your 90.5% bounce rate with only 2m 15s session duration indicates visitors are landing and immediately leaving without engaging with your core features.

**WHAT TO DO:** 
1. Add an interactive "Try It Now" word search widget directly on your homepage - a simple 8x8 puzzle with 4-5 words that takes 30 seconds to solve
2. After completion, show a popup: "Great job! Create your own puzzle in 2 minutes" with a bright CTA button to the generator
3. Place this widget above the fold, before any explanatory text
4. Add a visual timer/progress bar to create urgency and engagement

**EXPECTED IMPACT:** High - Interactive content immediately demonstrates value and reduces cognitive load. Even a 20-point bounce rate reduction (from 90.5% to 70%) would double your engaged user base, likely increasing generator usage and return visits. The "try before you create" approach removes friction and builds confidence in your tool's quality.
