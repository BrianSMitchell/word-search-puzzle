## Recommendation

**RECOMMENDATION: Bridge Blog-to-Product with Embedded CTAs**

**WHY:** 100% of traffic hits blog posts while core features (puzzle generator, daily puzzles) have zero views, indicating readers aren't converting to users despite arriving via content.

**WHAT TO DO:** Immediately add a sticky banner or inline widget to all blog posts above the fold: "Try This: Create a Custom Word Search" linking to the generator. Use high-contrast buttons and embed a mini 5x5 demo puzzle that links to the full tool when clicked.

**EXPECTED IMPACT:** High - Captures existing traffic before they bounce (currently 100% bounce rate) and transforms informational visits into product engagement, while improving internal link structure for SEO.
