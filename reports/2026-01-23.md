## Recommendation

**RECOMMENDATION: Implement Exit-Intent Popups with Value Proposition**

**WHY:** With only 2 visitors but 100% bounce rate and decent session duration (3m 44s), users are engaging with content but leaving without converting or exploring further pages.

**WHAT TO DO:** 
1. Install exit-intent popup software (OptinMonster or similar)
2. Create a popup offering "5 Free Premium Puzzle Templates" in exchange for email signup
3. Trigger when users move cursor toward browser's close/back button
4. Include preview thumbnails of puzzle themes (Christmas, Sports, Animals)
5. Add secondary CTA: "Or try our Daily Puzzle" linking to /daily-word-search
6. A/B test popup timing: exit-intent vs. 2-minute delay

**EXPECTED IMPACT:** High - This directly addresses the bounce rate problem by giving users a compelling reason to stay and providing immediate value. Exit-intent popups typically convert 2-4% of abandoning visitors, and even converting 1 of those 2 daily visitors would improve key metrics while building an email list for future engagement and traffic generation.
