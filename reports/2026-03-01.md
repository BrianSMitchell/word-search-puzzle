## Recommendation

**RECOMMENDATION: Deploy Long-Tail SEO Landing Pages**

**WHY:** Zero traffic indicates zero discoverability. Word search is a high-intent, search-driven niche (e.g., "printable Christmas word search PDF"), yet the site lacks entry points for organic acquisition.

**WHAT TO DO:** Create 10 theme-specific landing pages targeting low-competition keywords (e.g., "free dinosaur word search printable," "Valentine's day word search PDF"). Each page must include: (1) Interactive puzzle above the fold, (2) Prominent PDF download button, (3) 300+ words of thematic content, (4) Schema markup for CreativeWork. Submit XML sitemap to Google Search Console immediately.

**EXPECTED IMPACT:** High - Long-tail puzzle keywords have consistent volume with weak competition; ranking for 10 terms typically drives 500+ daily organic visitors within 60 days.
