## Recommendation

**RECOMMENDATION: Emergency Zero-Engagement Fix**

**WHY:** A 100% bounce rate with 4-second average duration indicates visitors land, see no immediate interactive value, and leave instantly. With only 6 daily visitors, you're burning 100% of acquisition efforts due to a broken first impression.

**WHAT TO DO:** 1) Audit for mobile/console errors and ensure load time is under 2 seconds. 2) Replace your homepage hero text with an embedded, playable 5x5 mini word search grid that works without scrolling ("play in 10 seconds" hook). 3) Add a high-contrast "Generate Your Puzzle" button above the fold. Remove any email capture popups or splash screens.

**EXPECTED IMPACT:** High - Reducing bounce rate from 100% to even 70% gives you 2 engaged users daily to study and iterate on, making all future traffic efforts non-wasteful.
