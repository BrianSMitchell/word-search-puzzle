## Recommendation

**RECOMMENDATION: Seed Niche Reddit Communities**

**WHY:** Zero traffic signals a distribution problem, not a product problem. Word searches have high virality in specific interest groups (teachers, fandoms, parents) who actively seek free printable activities.

**WHAT TO DO:** Create 3 timely puzzles (e.g., "Women's History Month Word Search") and post to hyper-relevant subreddits (r/Teachers, r/homeschool, specific fandom subs). Title: "I made a free [Topic] word search for my students—no signup needed to print." Link directly to the puzzle page, not homepage. Respond to every comment personally.

**EXPECTED IMPACT:** High - Immediate qualified traffic validates your conversion funnel, generates initial backlinks, and identifies which themes convert best for your SEO content strategy.
