## Recommendation

**RECOMMENDATION: Emergency Site Health Check & Recovery**

**WHY:** Zero traffic across all metrics indicates a critical technical issue - your site is likely completely down, blocked by search engines, or experiencing a severe technical failure that's preventing any user access.

**WHAT TO DO:** 
1. Immediately check if your website loads by visiting it directly in an incognito browser window
2. Verify DNS settings and hosting status with your provider
3. Check Google Search Console for crawl errors, manual actions, or indexing issues
4. Test from multiple locations using tools like downforeveryoneorjustme.com
5. Review recent changes to code, hosting, or domain settings
6. If site loads fine, verify Google Analytics tracking code is properly installed and firing

**EXPECTED IMPACT:** High - This is a site-breaking issue that's preventing all traffic and revenue. Every hour of downtime means lost visitors, search ranking damage, and potential long-term SEO impact. Fixing this is the only priority until normal traffic resumes.
