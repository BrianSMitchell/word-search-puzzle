## Recommendation

**RECOMMENDATION: Launch Long-Tail SEO Landing Pages**

**WHY:** With only 6 page views and 100% bounce rate, the site lacks organic visibility and clear intent matching. Traffic is too low for conversion optimization; you need discoverability and targeted entry points first.

**WHAT TO DO:** Create 10 specific landing pages targeting "printable [theme] word search" keywords (e.g., "printable Valentine's Day word search," "printable basketball word search") with embedded puzzles, clear PDF download CTAs, and optimized meta titles/descriptions. Submit these URLs to Google Search Console immediately.

**EXPECTED IMPACT:** High - These long-tail terms have lower competition and high commercial intent (users actively seeking to print), directly leveraging your PDF functionality to capture qualified traffic that your generic homepage isn't attracting.
