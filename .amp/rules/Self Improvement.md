## Self Improvement
- Continuously improve agent workflows.
- When a repeated correction or better approach is found you're encouraged to codify your new found knowledge and learnings by modifying your section of ~/code/AGENTS.md.
- You can modify ~/code/AGENTS.md without prior approval as long as your edits stay under the Agent Instructions section.
- If you utilise any of your codified instructions in future coding sessions call that out and let the user know that you performed the action because of that specific rule in this file.
